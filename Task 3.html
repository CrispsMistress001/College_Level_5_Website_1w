        <h1>Critical review of using E-Commerce</h1>
        <p>Being E-commerce business, you get some benefits but also some disadvantages of being online.
            <br>Here are some benefits of E-Commerce:
            </p>
        <div class="SideBoxes">
            <div>
                <h1>Faster buying process</h1>
                <p>Customers can spend less time trying to find specific product they are looking for, as they can access the website, type the product they would like to buy and just go through a list and pick whatever they are more interested in.<br><br>
                    This makes the process extremely quick and less tedious which would interest customers as they do not require to go outside and walk to the shop to get the product.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Display of multitudes of products</h1>
                <p>This is the advantage that the business gets with this, it can display as many products as it wants to as they are not limited by shop capacity as its all electronic, and they can add descriptions, images, specifications, and more to the product to attract customer on buying it.<br><br>
                    This also gives advantage to the customer too if they are looking for something specific or would like to see their options, so customer can get exactly what they need or want.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Cost reduction</h1>
                <p>The cost is much cheaper than owning an actual shop, as to display your products in standard manner you would need to buy or rent a property which you can sell products which comes with big expenses as not only you spending on the property itself but also on display cases or other parts to attract customers to have a look at your products.<br><br>
                    In E-Commerce and shops, you require a place to store your products which would be either warehouse or rented/bought property, but in E-Commerce there is no need to buy display cases or shelves, or have place taken care and modified to appeal to customers but also servers can websites can be really affordable now a days making cost cheaper to own E-Commerce business than actual business with a shop.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Advertisement</h1>
                <p>If your business runs online, you do not require to spend money on billboards or radio or place to be on newspaper as your business is all online, there are places that a lot of people visit online such as Facebook or other website that uses google ads.<br><br>
                    This makes advertisement much cheaper as you can use google ads or Facebook or other online place where you can put ads of your shop/products for a cheap price compared to getting whole billboard setup.<br><br>
                    (Facebook cost to displaying ads to 1000 people on their app is $12.07 which is extremely cheap. (Dopson, 2022))
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Flexibility for customers:</h1>
                <p>E-Commerce website is on 24/7 which means it is available at any time so customer does not need to wait for store to open to order products. The advantages come with being online is availability in terms of different locations as your business could be located in America but you can deliver products to UK with ease.(Amazon, 2021)</p>

    <div class="Main Main2" >
        <p>But there are some problems with such a business approach and it includes:</p>
        <div class="SideBoxes">
            <div>
                <h1>Privacy and security concern</h1>
                <p>There are some customers that do not like providing their personal information especially bank details or credit card details, this means they would not use your online services but would rather see a shop. But because of this reason E-Commerce business must have lots of security placed on it and not just encryptions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Lack of personal engagement</h1>
                <p>Due to being online you can only see images of the product and videos, which means you cannot touch the product to see its quality or see an actual size of it as you physically cannot until you purchase the product.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Extra cost of being online</h1>
                <p>The cost of setting up a server and maintaining it will be quite costly as if you are a small business, you will either need to spend more time on the website or either employ a person that will do that for you which adds more cost.<br><br>
                    There are solutions that allow you to have online store that is automatic and people that work with it provide updates and maintenance.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Need for workers</h1>
                <p>Even being online some would expect that business would have less need for workers which would benefit the business but in reality, it is other way around, as not just now you need people that deal with marketing, customer support and dealing with transactions such as delivery but need also people that work in the warehouse and people who can maintain their network as well as those who can improve the website itself.<br><br>
                    This adds up with a big cost as you require many workers to ensure business works flawlessly. (Shaw, 2020)

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <div class="TextB1">
            <p>Conclusion. There are both problems and benefits to the online business which does put more work to handle but comes with its own benefits, if a business is quite big then having both a shop and a website would be best option as it allows people to see things and purchase things locally and if they cannot get to the shop, they can purchase it online. But if business is small then using providers such as Amazon or eBay to sell your products or get other provider that maintains server for you would be better a solution.
