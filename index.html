        <h1>Importance of customer expectations in E-Commerce</h1>
        <div class="Block Pa1">
            <p>E-commerce for its income and improvements relies heavily on the customers 
                as its whole aim is for customers to order products online. This means if there 
                are no customers visiting the website and ordering products means there is no 
                income to the business which means it will go bankrupt which will just end the 
                business.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="Block Pa2">
            <p>This is where the customer expectation is really important, as to get 
                customers to use your services and the website you must appeal to them and
                 have them like it. Carrying on with that process will give business a great
                  income due to products that been sold and due to good feedbacks and better
                   reputation at the end business will get more customers.</p>

        <h1>Why UI and design is important on E-Commerce?</h1>
        <div class="TextB1">
            <p>Due to how websites progressed having a design that looks as if it been developed about 20 years ago wonâ€™t go well, as this will conflict with how customer feels about the websites, may take it as unreliable as it seems to be old or just does not feel modern that it would prevent users form using it just due to sheer feel of it.
                Which is why modern design being important as it will be main point that customers look at when they visit a website and main point that can influence the decision of person to carry on with using the website or not.</p>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <div class="TextB1">
            <p>UI layout is also important, customers expect E-Commerce websites to have user friendly UI layout that would allow even people who are not familiar with technology to use it, so having a bad UI layout and locations can add frustration to the customer which can make customer hate the website or have a want to switch to different business.</p>
