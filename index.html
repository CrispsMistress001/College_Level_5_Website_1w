        <h1>Importance of customer expectations in E-Commerce</h1>
        <div class="Block Pa1">
            <p>E-commerce for its income and improvements relies heavily on the customers 
                as its whole aim is for customers to order products online. This means if there 
                are no customers visiting the website and ordering products means there is no 
                income to the business which means it will go bankrupt which will just end the 
                business.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="Block Pa2">
            <p>This is where the customer expectation is really important, as to get 
                customers to use your services and the website you must appeal to them and
                 have them like it. Carrying on with that process will give business a great
                  income due to products that been sold and due to good feedbacks and better
                   reputation at the end business will get more customers.</p>

        <h1>Why UI and design is important on E-Commerce?</h1>
        <div class="TextB1">
            <p>Due to how websites progressed having a design that looks as if it been developed about 20 years ago won’t go well, as this will conflict with how customer feels about the websites, may take it as unreliable as it seems to be old or just does not feel modern that it would prevent users form using it just due to sheer feel of it.
                Which is why modern design being important as it will be main point that customers look at when they visit a website and main point that can influence the decision of person to carry on with using the website or not.</p>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <div class="TextB1">
            <p>UI layout is also important, customers expect E-Commerce websites to have user friendly UI layout that would allow even people who are not familiar with technology to use it, so having a bad UI layout and locations can add frustration to the customer which can make customer hate the website or have a want to switch to different business.</p>

        <h1>What features are important in E-Commerce to help customer satisfaction?</h1>
        <div class="SideBoxes">
            <div>
                <h1>Reviews</h1>
                <p>Customers now adays expect their website to have customer review functionality, as product can be looking great on the paper and on the pictures but it does not show how well it functions or lasts in reality which is why customers expect E-Commerce website to have review system to see how other users that have bought it feel about it.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Return</h1>
                <p>This also includes service if customer is not happy with the product they have purchased and would either want to return it or have a swap, this also is expected from the website as if you have purchased something that you did not like you would expect the company to give you a refund if you return the item back to them, as otherwise you would have scammed the customer lowering the reputation of your business.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Delivery</h1>
                <p>Due to being online and not having shop, E-Commerce websites are expected to deliver the products through delivery methods such as Royal mail, DPD or parcel force. This is not just it, customer also must be informed about when their parcel has been dispatched and when it expected to be delivered, in failure to do so will make customer feel like they have been scammed, as having no details about the arrival of the package and no further communication after the purchase would seem suspicious and seem that product has not been proceeded which again will lower the reputation of the business, so having at least email update will be good enough.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Accessibility</h1>
                <p>Some people in the world have disabilities that could damage eyesight or movement or more… In this case they are either forced to use E-Commerce to buy things or have difficulty using it which is why having accessibility is important as mentioned customers are number 1 priority in this business so making sure even people with disabilities can access the website would be great for the business.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Accounts</h1>
                <p>Having a way the customer can track their purchases, have logs for warranty and return, and control of their addresses and payments would be amazing as that means they do not require to put details again if they need to buy something they can just do it in tap of the button which just makes use of the E-Commerce website much easier and friendlier.</p>
