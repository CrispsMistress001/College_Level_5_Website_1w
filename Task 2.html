        <h1>Analysis of 2 E-Commerce businesses</h1>
        <h1>Amazon</h1>
        <p>Amazon has made itself to be the biggest business in terms of selling products, the ease of use combined with a great design and support made Amazon extremely popular choice if you would like to buy new products.</p>
        <div class="Block Pa1">
            <p>What did the company do?</p>
            <div class="LineSeparator"></div>
            <p>Made a huge website that is pleasant in aesthetics and the layout, it was done so well that the usage of the website was so easy and simple that it became popular. These advantages come with great support for customers such as returns policies and reviews and etc… The site can also recommend the item you are looking for on other websites if you do not like the price or would prefer a different website.<br><br>
                They have added support for other sellers to add their products on the list meaning if you would like to buy Nike trainers or other stuff that was not made by Amazon, it is all possible all a customer has to do is to use their search engine to find product they are looking for, this also gives advantage of finding products you may not have thought about it, allowing you to try out new things.<br><br>
                It did take Amazon quite a while to reach this state but main reason why the business went crazy high is due to their focus on customer satisfaction.
                </p>
                
        </div><br><br>

        <div class="Block Pa2">
            <p>Did that action help to improve their business? How?</p>
            <div class="LineSeparator"></div>
            <p>The business net revenue has sky rocketed from starting at year 2007 about at 2 billion dollars to about 120 billion dollars due to high satisfaction rates of the websites, this made it popular to use which has increased its user’s amount.</p>
        </div><br><br>

        <div class="Block Pa1">
            <p>How did it go right?</p>
            <div class="LineSeparator"></div>
            <p>The idea that they have built made business extremely popular and successful as now they have multiple income streams as well as highly positive customer review means now if you want to see and find certain product your first thought is to search it on amazon.</p>
        </div><br><br>

        <div class="Block Pa2">
            <p>How did it go wrong?</p>
            <div class="LineSeparator"></div>
            <p>The concern now that amazon has are the fake reviews as being one of the popular E-Commerce businesses you get really targeted with fake reviews on it so other businesses can profit from it, which can harm businesses Amazons reputation as being unreliable.<br><br>
                Another problem came through is the expectations as Amazon proven itself to be a really great company to buy things from but due to those expectations went higher and now the rating of satisfied customers went down form being about 86% down to 78%.
                </p>
        </div><br><br>

        <div class="Block Pa1">
            <p>Conclusion and recommendation</p>
            <div class="LineSeparator"></div>
            <p>Amazon has made a good decision with improving and making better each side of their E-Commerce business which is by either improving customer support or either making review system or ease of use and purchases on the website.<br><br>
                There is not much wrong with the business as mentioned they made a great job at improving it. But they do have established higher expectations for other businesses and themselves too so if they want to stay great, they need to keep delivering and improving what customers expect from them.

    <div class="Main Main2" >
        <h1>eBay</h1>
        <p>eBay has proven itself to be also one of the reliable services for selling products, but unlike Amazon which has its own products to sell eBay doesn’t, its E-Commerce business is focused on providing help and services to other companies that are trying to sell their stuff online.<br><br>
            But it does not end here as they also allow non-businesses to sell stuff like old laptop or selling something used from customers.
            </p>
            <div class="Block Pa1">
                <p>What did the company do?</p>
                <div class="LineSeparator"></div>
                <p>Made an E-Commerce website that is available to anyone including the standard consumers to sell their staff similar to Amazon, which is why it is popular to sell stuff including used, so the business got its name for being best place if you are trying to save up money by either buying things used or getting a better deal on it than on Amazon.<br><br>

                    They have also improved customer satisfaction by also providing return policies and scam protections which is why it is still classified as reliable.
                    </p>
                    
            </div><br><br>
    
            <div class="Block Pa2">
                <p>Did that action help to improve their business? How?</p>
                <div class="LineSeparator"></div>
                <p>Yes, being able to now just show businesses products but also used stuff improved the business as now they get income not from businesses that list their items on sale but also from people generally wanting to sell their used stuff through transactions.<br><br>
                    The business also due to its easy of selling and setup, you can find things that you would not find on Amazon which could be either old type of electronics or something that you would not see on the market just as a stand-alone purchase such as computer parts such as LCDs for laptops, keyboard for laptops, mobile parts and more...<br><br>
                    Due to that growth and ease of use business has sky rocketed and became one of the popular places to buy things and sell things from.<br><br>
                    Its revenue went from year 2014 at about $2150 million dollars to about $3050 million at the start of 2021.

            <div class="Block Pa1">
                <p>How did it go right?</p>
                <div class="LineSeparator"></div>
                <p>Having features such as Amazon with reviews, customer support and search and many more in terms of functionality it is practically identical but allowing more people to use it made it successful.<br><br>
                    Even had achieved to get 50% of mobile purchases overall from eBay
                    </p>
            </div><br><br>
    
            <div class="Block Pa2">
                <p>How did it go wrong?</p>
                <div class="LineSeparator"></div>
                <p>Due to selling used stuff and allowing small companies to sell their stuff the business has gotten a reputation for not being 100% trustworthy. As you could find listings that are not what they actually are, and some sellers that sell used stuff do not allow returns which makes it little hard to purchase things and get most out of the product.</p>
            </div><br><br>
    
            <div class="Block Pa1">
                <p>Conclusion and recommendation</p>
                <div class="LineSeparator"></div>
                <p>eBay has made itself successful and made itself to be one of the websites where you can either sell your stuff or buy used/new products even including the things you cannot get on Amazon or can but with a cheaper price tag. So, first thing on your mind when you want to save money will be eBay.<br><br>
                    As it has customer support and returns just like Amazon so it is not lacking in features and functionality which is why it gained respect form businesses and customers.<br><br>
                    </p>
